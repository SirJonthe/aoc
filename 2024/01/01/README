# About
The solution to day 1, part 1 of Advent of Code 2024.

# Notes
I have only tested if this works on x86/x64 Linux. There is a good chance that this will not compile on other platforms, and a good chance that the program will not behave correctly under ARM.

# Compiling
Install `SDL2` development files.

Then, compile the computer using the Makefile
```
make computer
```

When successful this will create a native binary, `computer`. Then compile the solution ROM:
```
make solution
```

When successful, this will create a ROM named `solution.rom`.

# Running
If the compilation of the computer and the ROM were successful, use the Makefile and type:
```
make run
```

This will boot the computer, load the ROM, and then execute it.

# Debugging
The ROM binary can be debugged by stepping through its assembly. Using the Makefile, type:
```
make debug
```
